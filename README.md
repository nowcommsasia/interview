# Interview

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Database

The endpoint to the test database for this interview has been setup.

An example to retrieve data from the Firebase endpoint can be found in /src/services/notes.service.ts.

## Objective

The objective of this test is to evaluate the candidate's capability in the following areas by building a simple note taking application:

1. Handling CRUD with Firebase
2. Comfort in building a web application with Angular
3. Developing a proper user interface to interact with the note taking application

You are allowed to use as many assumptions as you like, but don't forget to explain it.
